# Audiot

Audiot is a reasonably advanced GUI tool for midi generation.  It allows for dynamic and isolated virtual device creation.  Each device can be bound to a channel and XML-configuration (relative to a hardware or software device). MIDI note and control change messages can be built utilizing relative device values.

### Included Configurations
- Blofeld (our favorite)
- Minitaur
- SH-01a

Configurations can be found in ```AudiotLogic/ControlConfigs/```

### Use

### Build
- Restore NuGet dependencies
- Select "Audiot" as the startup program
- Build/Run

### Limitations
There are a lot, but hopefully making this repository public will encourage more support or personal modification possible.
